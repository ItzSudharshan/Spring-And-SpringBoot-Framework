Why Annotations are a Game-Changer?
Annotations like @Autowired simplify dependency injection by bringing configuration closer to the code. Here’s how they help:
📝 Code Simplicity:
Dependencies are defined directly within the code, eliminating the need for separate XML files.

📚 Better Readability:
Developers can see the dependencies in the class itself, making the code easier to understand.

🛠️ Reduces Boilerplate Code:
With annotations, you write less and focus more on the actual functionality. ✍️

⚙️ Flexible and Customizable:
Provides the ability to override configurations while keeping things simple.
